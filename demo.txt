What is your favorite movie?
Steve Jobs. I'm a sucker for Sorkin dialogue and the Mac

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
Tierra Del Fuego. I've been able to travel to the Galapagos Islands, many places in South America, out in the Masai Mara in Kenya, and to a handful of cities in Europe. So next I'd love to explore the far southern part of South America and maybe take a cruise to Antarctica. 

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
I'd choose to be able to speak any language. It's a superpower you could actually use and not be a maniac flying around or something, and would be just absolutely awesome all the time.
